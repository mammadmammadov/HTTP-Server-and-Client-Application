# HTTP Server and Client Application

This repository contains a simple implementation of a server and client for HTTP communication.

## How to Run the Server

1. Compile the `Server.java` file:
    ```bash
    javac Server.java
    ```
2. Run the server with the following command:
    ```bash
    java Server [IP address] [Port Number]
    ```
   - Replace `[IP address]` with the desired IP address.
   - Replace `[Port Number]` with the port number you wish to use.

## How to Run the Client

1. Compile the `HttpClient.java` file:
    ```bash
    javac HttpClient.java
    ```
2. Run the client with the following command:
    ```bash
    java HttpClient
    ```

## Note
- The server must be running before the client initiates a connection.
